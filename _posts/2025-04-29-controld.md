excerpt: "With so many video games available to play on various platforms, it can be challenging to find the true gems. That is what my project for a software engineering course is made to solve. Control'D, an Android app, is a review-based social media platform. As a user, find games you've played and write a public review, or browse through the reviews generated by other users to find your next favorite game. Follow friends, like reviews, and create a game collection for others to see. With this app, you'll feel more connected to fellow video game enthusiasts, and may discover games you've never heard of before. With the implementation of Google's Firebase to help run the backend, anyone can create their own account and save all of their favorite games, reviews made, followers, and those following them."

        This semester-long project was made possible with four classmates and me. Although we explored all the various aspects of an app to gain a better understanding and to help each other, my primary focus was on the backend. For this project, my primary responsibility lies in the account section and the reviews. The account creation and sign-in pages were fully developed by me. Apart from helping out and contributing to many features equally, I also primarily led the connection of various buttons found in the app, such as the game icons and navigation bar.

        At the end of the semester, our app was brought to the general public at a showcase event on campus. The students and faculty attending the event were able to create their own accounts, browse our game catalog, and write their own reviews, which future guests would then be able to read. Those who sampled our app gave positive feedback and had a lot of joy in reading what others had said about some of their favorite games.
